            <h3>WHY BRESKENS?</h3>
            <h2>Picturesque fishing village by the Western Scheldt</h2>
            <p>
              Breskens was founded in 1510. <br />
              On 11 September 1944, the town was bombed by Allied forces,
              leaving very little of the historical centre intact. After the
              war, the town was rebuilt and became a centre for the Dutch fish
              industry and other maritime-related businesses.<br />
              In the nineties the fishing industry declined and tourism became
              the main economic focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Breskens is situated behind a line of dunes. There is plenty to
              see and do in and around town. A walk along the seafront will
              afford great views across the Western Scheldt. Perhaps you’ll even
              spot seals! Also don’t miss out on the Fishery Festival. It’s the
              largest festival in Zeeland.

              Hello! My name is Lianne. I dedicated this page to the village I
              grew up in. After moving to Berlin many years ago, I still enjoy
              coming back to Breskens and breath in the fresh breeze.
